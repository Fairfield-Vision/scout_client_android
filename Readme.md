This is the Fairfield Scout Android client.

It is a fork of AVNC (https://github.com/gujjwal00/avnc) which has been modified to connect to the Fairfild Scout via bluetooth.

The source code is provided here under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence v3

While this is specifically designed to be used with the Fairfield scout, it could be used to connect to any VNC server that exposes a bluetooth interface.
